          <h3>1. What’s New with Google Ads?</h3>
          <p>Google has introduced a new feature that groups all ads into one section under the **“Sponsored Results”** label, making it easier for users to distinguish between organic and paid search results. You’ll also find a **“Hide Sponsored Results”** button, allowing you to collapse the sponsored ads after viewing them.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="why-it-matters">
          <h3>2. Why This Matters for Users and Advertisers</h3>
          <p>This change allows users to navigate Google Search results with greater ease, reducing clutter at the top of the page. For advertisers, it means the ad format will be more transparent, which may impact click-through rates and engagement.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-to-hide">
          <h3>3. How to Hide Ads in Google Search</h3>
          <p>Once you’ve viewed the sponsored results, a button will appear allowing you to hide them. This option is manual, but it gives users greater control over their search experience.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="impact-on-ads">
          <h3>4. The Impact of This Change on Ads Performance</h3>
          <p>For advertisers, the new layout could change how users engage with sponsored results. Ads that are visually distinct might see fewer clicks, especially from users who are more selective about which content they engage with.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="ad-labels">
          <h3>5. New Ad Labels and Transparency</h3>
          <p>The **“Sponsored”** label will now be used consistently across all paid ad formats, including Shopping results. This provides clearer transparency, helping users easily identify which results are paid placements.</p>
